                Gianni Versace S.r.l., usually referred to as Versace, is an
                Italian luxury fashion company founded by Gianni Versace in 1978
                known for flashy prints and bright colors. Versace became
                internationally renowned for ultra-glamorous creations as well
                as spectacular theatrical costumes and innovative menswear
                design.

            <p>
                You can count on one hand the number of fashion houses that
                enjoy the name recognition that Versace does. Today, under the
                leadership of Donatella Versace—just as in the ’80s and ’90s
                when the brand was run by her brother Gianni—it is a universal
                symbol of all that is glamorous and decadent. Versace doesn’t
                make clothes that are avant-garde, arty, or untouchably elegant;
                it makes clothes for red carpet photo calls in Cannes and
                parties aboard a rap mogul’s mega-yacht in Monaco.

                He created distinctive, at the edge designs that achieved the
                aesthetic limit of the avant-garde and the commercial success of
                viable apparel. Versace was a consummate craftsman with his
                insistence upon directing all aspects of his fashion, from
                publicity and his books, to the exhibitions.

            <h2>History And Operation</h2>
            <p>
                In 1972, Gianni Versace designed his first collections for
                Callaghan, Genny, and Complice. In 1978, the company launched
                under the name "Gianni Versace Donna” and opened its first
                boutique in Milan's Via della Spiga. Gianni independently
                controlled much of the brand, from designing to retailing. In
                1982, the company expanded its offerings to include accessories,
                jewelry, home furnishings, and china. In 1993, Donatella Versace
                added the Young Versace and Versus lines. In 1994, the brand
                gained international coverage from the black Versace dress of
                Elizabeth Hurley, referred in the media as "that dress". Versace
                has designed for various music artists, including stage and
                album cover costumes for Elton John in 1992 and outfits for
                Michael Jackson. Versace also designed clothing for the Princess
                of Wales and Princess Caroline of Monaco. After the murder of
                Gianni Versace in 1997, his sister Donatella, formerly
                vice-president, took over as creative director, and his older
                brother Santo Versace became CEO. Donatella's daughter Allegra
                Versace was left a 50 percent stake in the company, which she
                assumed control of on her eighteenth birthday. In 2000, the
                green Versace dress worn by Jennifer Lopez at the Grammy Awards
                gained extensive media attention. The dress was voted the fifth
                most iconic dress of all time and Elizabeth Hurley's black
                Versace dress was voted most iconic dress of all time, according
                to a 2008 Daily Telegraph poll.With the company's profits in
                decline in the early 2000s,Fabio Massimo Cacciatori was hired as
                interim CEO to reorganise and restructure Versace Group in 2003.
                Cacciatori resigned in December 2003 due to "disputes with the
                Versace family". In 2004, Giancarlo di Risio from IT Holding
                became CEO, until he resigned in 2009 due to disagreements with
                Donatella. In May 2016, the Versace Group appointed Jonathan
                Akeroyd as CEO and board member. In February 2014, The
                Blackstone Group purchased a 20 percent stake in Versace for
                €210 million. As of 2016, more than 1500 boutiques operate
                worldwide; the first boutique outside of Italy opened in
                Glasgow, Scotland, in 1991. In September 2018, Michael Kors
                offered to buy Versace for two billion euros. Versace announced
                all Blackstone and Versace family shares were sold to Michael
                Kors Limited.[34] The acquisition was completed in December
                2018, with Donatella Versace remaining head of creative design.
                In January 2019, Gianni Versace S.r.l. joined Capri Holdings
                Limited, forming a new global fashion luxury group alongside
                Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo. In 2018, Versace stopped using fur
                in its products and in 2020 announced it would stop using
                kangaroo leather. In October 2018, Versace announced its first
                Pre-Fall season show in New York, scheduled on Gianni Versace's
                December 2 birth date. In 2021, Versace opened its first SoHo,
                New York boutique.

                In September of 2018 Versace announced that one hundred percent
                of all Blackstone and Versace family shares had been sold to the
                Group Michael Kors Limited. In January 2019, Gianni Versace
                S.r.l. joined Capri Holdings Limited, forming a new global
                fashion luxury group together with Michael Kors and Jimmy Choo.
